## Stakeholders

### Name: Jason Hu

**Summary**:
Inconsistent gym goer who has a busy schedule but wants to fit going to the gym into their daily routine. They don’t want to rely on their unreliable memory to keep track of their gym progress and would appreciate having a user-friendly tracking system. 

**Goals/Needs**:
1. Being more consistent with exercising to improve his health
2. Planning out the exercises he wants to do in a week
3. Being able to see and track his progress for motivation
4. Seeing visible data of his progress to optimize workouts over time

**Problems**:
1. Forgetting how much weight he can lift in the past
2. Not committing to a certain workout schedule 
3. Feeling unmotivated due to lack of tangible progress
4. Hitting a fitness plateau and not knowing what to change in his routine

## Product Vision Statement

A mobile application designed to allow users to track their workout progress by logging completed exercises, scheduling workout plans, and generating health statistics based on their performance data.

## User Requirements

2. As a visualizer, I want to be able to see my monthly progress at-a-glance to track my consistent progress with ease.
3. As a regular user, I want to schedule my workout plans ahead of time so that I can stay organized and focused on my fitness goals.
4. As a user who missed a workout, I want to reschedule my planned exercises so that I can stay on track with my fitness routine.
5. As a gym-goer, I want to track my weight and BMI so that I can see how much progress I am making.
6. As an advanced user, I want to track specific details like weight lifted or sets completed so that I can fine-tune my workouts for better results.
7. As a user who enjoys variety, I want to log different types of exercises (e.g., cardio, strength training, flexibility) so that I can track all aspects of my fitness routine in one place.
8. As an athlete who likes taking progress pictures, I want to be able to upload progress pictures of myself to the calendar to look back upon.
9. As a user concerned with balance, I want to track the time spent on each type of workout (e.g., cardio vs. strength training) so that I can ensure I’m maintaining a balanced fitness regimen.
10. As a user focused on long-term goals, I want to view weekly or monthly summaries of my workouts so that I can see my overall progress.
